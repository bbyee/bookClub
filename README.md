# Origin Full Stack App

BookClub App

## Description

Build out a C.R.U.D full-stack application with the following functionality:

- Users should be able to register and login to maintain a list of personal favorite books.
- Users should be able to upload, update, and deletebooks, along with any book details (author, genre, etc) and notes on the reading material.
- Please allow for users to update the book object with a personal list of notes that they might want to add while reading.


## Getting Started

Git clone the following URL to a folder: https://github.com/bbyee/bookClub

### Prerequisites

Requires git to retrieve the packages, a node environment with npm available to run the files.

### Installing

Once the file has been cloned to a local folder, cd into the folder and npm install.

If you have nodemon in your environment you can run the following npm scripts to launch the program:

- `npm run react-dev`
- `npm run server-dev`

otherwise:

- `npm run react-dev`
- `node server/index.js`

To get the database started, run the following command in your terminal:

- `mysql -u root < database/schema.sql`

This command will generate the database and relevant tables.

In your browser, go to localhost:3000 to see the app and use it.
